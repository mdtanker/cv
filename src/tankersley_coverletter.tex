Dear Dr. Mantelli,

I am writing to express interest in the advertised postdoctoral
position in glacial geophysics at AWI and LMU. I believe this position will be an excellent
opportunity to expand my skill set in cryospheric research, following my
recently submitted Ph.D. in Antarctic geophysics. The first section of my Ph.D. used airborne magnetics data to identify
the thickness and distribution of sediments beneath the Ross Ice Shelf and
presented possible geologic controls on the overriding ice sheet
dynamics (\textit{Geophysical
    Research Letters}, \url{https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL097371}). The second section of my thesis involved developing a gravity
inversion algorithm, used to model bathymetry beneath
the Ross Ice Shelf. This research is in preparation for submission to a
research journal.

While my background has not focused directly on glaciology, I believe my
skill set is well suited to this position. I have extensive experience
with the full lifecycle of geophysical research, from survey design,
data collection, processing, and analysis. I have
spent over 16 weeks in remote field camps in Antarctica collecting
various types of geophysical data, including hot water drilling. Through my development of a Python
package, Antarctic-Plots, and contributions to various open-source
projects, I am proficient in coding and creating reproducible and
efficient processing workflows.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. If you have any
questions, please email me.
